This repository contains enterprise-grade network lab designs, documentation, and automation.

Hybrid Enterprise Architecture — Zero Trust Security Lab

Scenario: Simulated Fortune 500 hybrid OSPF/Zero Trust network.
Goal: Build and test a segmented enterprise network with firewalls, core routing, DHCP/DNS services, and end-to-end policy enforcement.

Skills Demonstrated

Zero Trust security design and segmentation

Stateful firewall configuration (ACLs, NAT, inspection policies)

DHCP relay and DNS forwarder integration (Bind9 on Alpine Linux)

OSPF infrastructure design and troubleshooting

Policy-Based Routing (PBR) for security enforcement

NAT and double-NAT across firewall/edge layers

Enterprise documentation and syslog analysis

The Architecture

Hybrid Design: OSPF for core infrastructure, Zero Trust for user traffic

Security Zones: 5-tier model (User, Web, App, DB, Mgmt)

Advanced Routing: PBR forcing security inspection before forwarding

Enterprise Scale: Dual-core switch design with ASA firewall at enforcement points

Visibility: Syslog, ACL hit-counts, and NAT translation tracking

Crisis Scenarios (To Be Built Out)

Asymmetric Routing Nightmare

Security Zone Bypass

TCP MSS Black Hole

PBR Loop of Death

DHCP Amplification

(Documented, not yet implemented — these will be added as labs progress.)

What Makes This Special

Real-world enterprise architecture recreated in Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)

DNS, DHCP, NAT, and firewall policies integrated with segmentation

Layered Zero Trust enforcement with scoped ACLs and least-privilege design

Serves as a showcase for advanced troubleshooting and enterprise thinking
