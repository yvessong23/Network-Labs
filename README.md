# Yves' Network & Security Labs

This is my personal repo where I document my ongoing work in network engineering, security architecture, and infrastructure design.

I'll be building a series of **real-world, enterprise-grade labs** focused on:
- 🔐 Zero Trust design
- ⚙️ Firewall and ACL enforcement
- 📡 Routing, VLAN segmentation, and traffic control
- ☁️ Future cloud + hybrid architecture testing

## 🏰 Current Lab — **Black Friday: Zero Trust Crisis Simulation**

My latest and most complete lab is a 12-device enterprise network simulating a real security crisis response environment.

> Goal: **No lateral movement. Every flow inspected. One firewall choke point.**
